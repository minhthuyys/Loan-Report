# Bank-Loan-Report
This is a project which uses SQL and Power BI:
For the SQL working tasks, I imported data into my local sql server and wrote queries:

For the Power BI working tasks. Here are some KPIs or charts I created:
**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:**
  1. Total Loan Applications: Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and Month-over-Month (MoM).
  2. Total Funded Amount: MTD Total Funded Amount and Month-over-Month (MoM).
  3. Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and Month-over-Month (MoM)
  4. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health, MTD, and Month-over-Month (MoM)

**Good loan and bad loan analysis**
  1. Good and Bad Loan Application Percentage
  2. Good and Bad Loan Applications
  3. Good and Bad Loan Funded Amount

**To monitor the performance of loans, we create a grid view report categorized by Loan Status!**

**Create some overview charts**
- Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart)
- Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map)
- Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart)
- Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart)
- Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart)
- Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map)

**Create a details chart**
